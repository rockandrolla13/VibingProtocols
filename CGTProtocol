# AI-Assisted Engineering Review Protocol (AERP)
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Convert high-velocity agent coding into *reliable, maintainable* production software with bounded risk, low slop, and controlled comprehension debt.  
**Scope:** Applies to any PR where ≥20% of code was AI-generated (agents, copilots, autop-run refactors).  
**Principle:** Humans own *problem definition, architecture, and verification*. Agents own *implementation throughput*.

## 0) Definitions (Use these words consistently)

- **Task Contract:** The written specification + success criteria for the change.
- **Assumption List:** Explicit assumptions the agent is making.
- **Verification Plan:** Tests + checks that demonstrate correctness.
- **Fresh-Context Review:** A second AI review performed from a clean prompt/window to reduce self-consistency bias.
- **Comprehension Debt:** Code you can “approve” but cannot explain, modify safely, or reason about.

## 1) Non-Negotiables (Hard Gates)

A PR **cannot** be opened (or must be set to Draft) unless:

1. A **Task Contract** exists in the PR description.
2. A **Verification Plan** exists and is implemented (tests or checks).
3. The agent has produced an **Assumption List** and it is reviewed/accepted.
4. The change is **bounded** (one intent, size limit respected).
5. The PR includes an **Explainability Note** (how it works + failure modes).

If any gate fails → stop and fix the process, not the code.

## 2) Roles & Responsibilities

### 2.1 Author (Human)
Owns:
- Task Contract correctness
- Scoping
- Final design decisions
- Verification strategy
- Merge readiness

### 2.2 Agent (LLM / Tool)
Owns:
- First draft implementation
- Test implementation
- Self-critique outputs (fresh-context review)
- Simplification pass outputs

### 2.3 Reviewer (Human)
Owns:
- Architectural correctness
- Invariants and boundaries
- Security / correctness scrutiny
- Verification sufficiency
- Comprehension check (must be able to explain)

---

## 3) Pre-Flight Setup (One-time per repo)

### 3.1 Set Repo Guardrails
Minimum required automation:
- Formatter (language-appropriate)
- Linter (strict mode if feasible)
- Type checker (where applicable)
- Unit tests in CI
- Coverage reporting (trend, threshold if mature)
- Security checks (SAST / dependency scan as feasible)

### 3.2 Enforce PR Constraints
Pick and enforce:
- **Max files changed:**
