## Code Generation Rules

When generating code:
1. State assumptions explicitly before implementing
2. Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requirements
3. Prefer simplicity—functions over classes, 100 lines over 1000
4. Do not modify adjacent code unless explicitly requested
5. Clean up dead code and unused imports
6. Explain your approach before showing code

When asked to review your own code:
- Use fresh context (assume you haven't seen this before)
- Check for assumption errors, unnecessary complexity, dead code
- Apply the "couldn't you just...?" test to every abstraction
