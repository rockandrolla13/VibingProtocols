You are my refactoring lead. Your job is to produce a step-by-step refactor plan that is executed in small, mergeable iterations.

Context:
- Language: Python
- Goal: reduce codebase from ~50k LOC to ~10k LOC by deleting dead code, collapsing abstractions, removing alternate modes, and minimizing commands/config surface.
- Untouchable modules: [LIST PATHS HERE, e.g. carry_strategy/, strategies/carry/]. These must not be modified. If a change is needed, do it via adapters outside the boundary.
- I want an iterative loop: refactor → test → refactor → test, plus a “usage test” by running a backtest each iteration.
- Each iteration must end by updating a markdown progress log at: docs/reduce/progress.md

Pre-Merge Requirements (must be satisfied each iteration, and used as acceptance criteria):
Comprehension Gates:
- Can explain implementation without reading code
- Could debug at 2am if broken (top 3 failure modes)
Quality Gates:
- Fresh-context review completed
- Passed “couldn’t you just…?” simplicity test
- No dead code or collateral changes
- Diff minimal and focused
Verification Gates:
- Success criteria defined before implementation
- Tests validate behavior, not just pass
- No adjacent system regression

Repo commands:
- Unit tests: [e.g. pytest -q]
- Lint/type checks: [e.g. ruff check ., mypy .] (if applicable)
- Backtest command (usage test): [e.g. python -m backtest.run --config configs/base.yaml --date 2025-...]
- LOC metric command: [e.g. python scripts/loc.py OR cloc .]

Your output must contain:

1) Refactor Strategy Overview (max 10 bullets):
- The main deletion levers (modes to remove, abstractions to collapse, duplicates to consolidate)
- The risk constraints given untouchable carry modules

2) A step-by-step plan with 8–20 iterations.
For EACH iteration provide:
- Intent (one sentence)
- Files/dirs to touch
- Exact code transformation (what is deleted/collapsed)
- Success criteria (what must remain true)
- Verification commands to run (tests + backtest + any others)
- Expected LOC delta (rough estimate)
- Fresh-context review prompt (the exact prompt I will use)
- The progress.md entry to append/update (exact text)
- A rollback note

3) A template for docs/reduce/progress.md:
Include sections:
- Baseline (date, LOC, tests, backtest config)
- Iteration log table with: iteration #, intent, LOC before/after, tests pass, backtest pass, notes
- “Deleted/avoided building” running list
- Risks/unknowns

Constraints:
- Keep iterations small (prefer <600 LOC touched, <10 files unless bulk deletion).
- No new dependencies during reduction.
- Prefer deletion over refactor. Prefer one canonical path.
- If you need information (repo layout, command outputs), list assumptions AND propose the safest default path.

Do not write code yet. Produce the plan only.
